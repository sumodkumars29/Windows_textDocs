:: shuts down the computer after a 30-second default timeout, showing a warning dialog to the user

cmd:	shutdown /s

:: Shuts down the computer right away.

cmd:	shutdown /s /t 0

:: forces all programs to close and restarts the computer immediately (0-second delay).

cmd:	shutdown /r /f /t 0

:: /r: Restart
:: /f: Force close applications
:: /t 0: Do it after 0 seconds (immediately)

::shut down the computer in 5 minutes (300 seconds), and you want to warn your colleague with a custom message.

cmd:	shutdown /s /t 300 /c "Server maintenance shutdown in 5 minutes. Please save your work."
	
:: stop the shutdown process as long as the countdown hasn't reached zero, only works during the timeout period

cmd:	shutdown /a

:: /a : abort

:: opens a graphical tool that lets you select multiple computers to shut down or restart, and specify a reason for the action (which is logged). 
:: This is primarily for system administrators in a domain environment.

cmd:	shutdown /i

/s	Shuts down the computer.
/r	Restarts the computer.
/l	Logs off the current user. (This is l as in "log", not the number 1).
/h	Puts the computer into Hibernate (if enabled).
/a	Aborts a system shutdown. Only works during the timeout period.
/f	Forces running applications to close without warning. Use with caution!
/t XXX	Sets a timeout period of XXX seconds before the action. Default is 30.
/c "comment"	Adds a comment (message) that will be displayed to the user.
/m \\ComputerName	Allows you to shut down a remote computer on the network.	


:: Important Notes & Tips
:: Run Command Prompt as Administrator: While basic shutdowns work in a normal Command Prompt, some actions (especially remote ones) require you to run Command Prompt as an Administrator.

:: Reasons for Shutdown (/d): The /d parameter is used to log the reason for the shutdown. This is almost exclusively used in corporate environments where shutdowns are tracked. You need specific codes (p for planned, u for unplanned, followed by a major and minor reason code).

:: Hibernate (/h): This only works if hibernation is enabled on your computer. You can enable it with the command powercfg /hibernate on in an admin Command Prompt.

:: Full Hybrid Shutdown (/s) vs. Full Shutdown: Modern Windows uses a "Fast Startup" (hybrid shutdown) by default when you click "Shut down" in the Start Menu. The shutdown /s command also performs this hybrid shutdown. To do a full shutdown (which clears the kernel session completely, useful for troubleshooting), you can use:

cmd:	shutdown /s /full /t 0

Usage: shutdown [/i | /l | /s | /sg | /r | /g | /a | /p | /h | /e | /o] [/hybrid] [/soft] [/fw] [/f]
    [/m \\computer][/t xxx][/d [p|u:]xx:yy [/c "comment"]]

    No args    Display help. This is the same as typing /?.
    /?         Display help. This is the same as not typing any options.
    /i         Display the graphical user interface (GUI).
               This must be the first option.
    /l         Log off. This cannot be used with /m or /d options.
    /s         Shutdown the computer.
    /sg        Shutdown the computer. On the next boot, if Automatic Restart Sign-On
               is enabled, automatically sign in and lock last interactive user.
               After sign in, restart any registered applications.
    /r         Full shutdown and restart the computer.
    /g         Full shutdown and restart the computer. After the system is rebooted,
               if Automatic Restart Sign-On is enabled, automatically sign in and
               lock last interactive user.
               After sign in, restart any registered applications.
    /a         Abort a system shutdown.
               This can only be used during the time-out period.
               Combine with /fw to clear any pending boots to firmware.
    /p         Turn off the local computer with no time-out or warning.
               Can be used with /d and /f options.
    /h         Hibernate the local computer.
               Can be used with the /f option.
    /hybrid    Performs a shutdown of the computer and prepares it for fast startup.
               Must be used with /s option.
    /fw        Combine with a shutdown option to cause the next boot to go to the
               firmware user interface.
    /e         Document the reason for an unexpected shutdown of a computer.
    /o         Go to the advanced boot options menu and restart the computer.
               Must be used with /r option.
    /m \\computer Specify the target computer.
    /t xxx     Set the time-out period before shutdown to xxx seconds.
               The valid range is 0-315360000 (10 years), with a default of 30.
               If the timeout period is greater than 0, the /f parameter is
               implied.
    /c "comment" Comment on the reason for the restart or shutdown.
               Maximum of 512 characters allowed.
    /f         Force running applications to close without forewarning users.
               The /f parameter is implied when a value greater than 0 is
               specified for the /t parameter.
    /d [p|u:]xx:yy  Provide the reason for the restart or shutdown.
               p indicates that the restart or shutdown is planned.
               u indicates that the reason is user defined.
               If neither p nor u is specified the restart or shutdown is
               unplanned.
               xx is the major reason number (positive integer less than 256).
               yy is the minor reason number (positive integer less than 65536).
