:: "robocopy" command

:: Designed for large, reliable, resumable copies. Handles retries, network interruptions, permissions, timestamps, and can mirror entire directory trees.

:: Syntax: 
	robocopy [source] [destination] [file(s)] [options]	


robocopy C:\data D:\backup /MIR /R:3 /W:5

/S: Copy subdirectories, but not empty ones.

/E → Copy all subdirectories (including empty).

/L: List only mode. A dry run. ALWAYS USE THIS WITH /MIR FIRST TO SEE WHAT WILL BE DELETED!

/MIR → Mirror source to destination (careful: deletes from destination if missing in source).

/Z → Copy files in restartable mode (resumes on interruption).

/ZB → Use restartable mode; fallback to backup mode if denied. Great for copying files in use.

/R:n → Retry n times on failure (default: 1 million!).

/W:n → Wait n seconds between retries.

/MT[:n] → Multi-threaded copy (default 8, max 128). Great for speeding up copies of many small files (e.g., /MT:16 or /MT:32).

/SEC → Copy security (NTFS ACLs).

/COPY:flags → Specify what to copy (D=data, A=attributes, T=timestamps, S=security, O=owner, U=audit).

/LOG:file.txt: Outputs the status to a log file (overwrites the existing log).

/LOG+:file.txt: Appends the status to the end of the log file.

/NP → No progress shown.

/DCOPY:T → Copy directory timestamps too.

/XO: eXclude Older files. Won't overwrite a newer file with an older one.

/XN: eXclude Newer files. Won't overwrite an older file with a newer one.

/XX: Don't copy extra files, only update existing ones.


:: Basic recursive copy
robocopy C:\SourceFolder D:\BackupFolder /E

:: Mirror a directory (WARNING: WILL DELETE FILES IN DESTINATION)
robocopy C:\ImportantData D:\MirrorBackup /MIR /LOG:backup.log

!! ALWAYS DO A DRY RUN FIRST WITH /MIR !!
robocopy C:\ImportantData D:\MirrorBackup /MIR /L

:: Fast copy using 16 threads, skipping newer files
robocopy C:\ProjectFiles Server\Backup /MT:16 /XO

::
:: Remarks :
::
       Using /PURGE or /MIR on the root directory of the volume formerly caused
       robocopy to apply the requested operation on files inside the System
       Volume Information directory as well. This is no longer the case; if
       either is specified, robocopy will skip any files or directories with that
       name in the top-level source and destination directories of the copy session.

       The modified files classification applies only when both source
       and destination filesystems support change timestamps (e.g., NTFS)
       and the source and destination files have different change times but are
       otherwise the same. These files are not copied by default; specify /IM
       to include them.

       The /DCOPY:E flag requests that extended attribute copying should be
       attempted for directories. Note that currently robocopy will continue
       if a directory's EAs could not be copied. This flag is also not included
       in /COPYALL.

       If either /IoMaxSize or /IoRate are specified, robocopy will enable
       copy file throttling (the purpose being to reduce system load).
       Both may be adjusted to allowable or optimal values; i.e., both
       specify desired copy parameters, but the system and robocopy are
       allowed to adjust them to reasonable/allowed values as necessary.
       If /Threshold is also used, it specifies a minimum file size for
       engaging throttling; files below that size will not be throttled.
       Values for all three parameters may be followed by an optional suffix
       character from the set [KMG] (kilo, mega, giga).

       Using /LFSM requests robocopy to operate in 'low free space mode'.
       In this mode, robocopy will pause whenever a file copy would cause the
       destination volume's free space to go below a 'floor' value, which
       can be explicitly specified by the LFSM:n[KMG] form of the flag.
       If /LFSM is specified with no explicit floor value, the floor is set to
       ten percent of the destination volume's size.
       Low free space mode is incompatible with /MT and /EFSRAW.
