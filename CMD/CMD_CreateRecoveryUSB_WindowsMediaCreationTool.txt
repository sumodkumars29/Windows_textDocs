Click Download Now to download the Media Creation Tool.
2. Prepare a USB Drive
Insert a USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage (all data on the USB will be erased).
Ensure it’s formatted as FAT32 (you can format it in File Explorer if needed).
3. Run the Media Creation Tool
Open the downloaded tool (e.g., MediaCreationTool20H2.exe).
Accept the license terms.
4. Choose to Create Installation Media
Select Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) and click Next.
Configure your preferences:
Language: Default or as per your needs.
Edition: Ensure it matches your current Windows version.
Architecture: Choose 64-bit (or both if unsure).

6. Wait for the Tool to Create the Bootable USB
The tool will download the necessary files and create a bootable recovery USB.
This process may take 15–30 minutes, depending on your internet speed.
