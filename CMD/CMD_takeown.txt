:: takeown → Used to take ownership of a file or folder.
:: Think of it like this:
:: Ownership (controlled by takeown) = who has the final say over the object.

:: Syntax
cmd : takeown [/s <computer>] [/u [<domain>\]<user>] [/p <password>] 
        [/f <filename>] [/a] [/r [/d {Y|N}]] [/skipsl]

:: Common switches

:: /f <filename> → Target file or folder.
:: /r → Recursive (all subfolders/files).
:: /d Y → Default answer “Yes” to confirmation prompts.
:: /a → Assigns ownership to the Administrators group instead of the user running the command.

:: Take ownership of a single file:
cmd : takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\myfile.dll

:: Take ownership of a folder and everything inside:
cmd : takeown /f C:\MyFolder /r /d Y

:: Assign ownership to the Administrators group instead of yourself:
cmd : takeown /f C:\MyFolder /a /r /d Y

TAKEOWN [/S system [/U username [/P [password]]]]
        /F filename [/A] [/R [/D prompt]]

Description:
    This tool allows an administrator to recover access to a file that
    was denied by re-assigning file ownership.

Parameter List:
    /S           system          Specifies the remote system to
                                 connect to.

    /U           [domain\]user   Specifies the user context under
                                 which the command should execute.

    /P           [password]      Specifies the password for the
                                 given user context.
                                 Prompts for input if omitted.

    /F           filename        Specifies the filename or directory
                                 name pattern. Wildcard "*" can be used
                                 to specify the pattern. Allows
                                 sharename\filename.

    /A                           Gives ownership to the administrators
                                 group instead of the current user.

    /R                           Recurse: instructs tool to operate on
                                 files in specified directory and all
                                 subdirectories.

    /D           prompt          Default answer used when the current user
                                 does not have the "list folder" permission
                                 on a directory.  This occurs while operating
                                 recursively (/R) on sub-directories. Valid
                                 values "Y" to take ownership or "N" to skip.

    /SKIPSL                      Do not follow symbolic links.
                                 Only applicable with /R.

    /?                           Displays this help message.

    NOTE: 1) If /A is not specified, file ownership will be given to the
             current logged on user.

          2) Mixed patterns using "?" and "*" are not supported.

          3) /D is used to suppress the confirmation prompt.
