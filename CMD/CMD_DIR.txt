dir *.jpg *.png /tc /od | findstr /c:"%date%"

dir *.pdf /s | findstr "dd-mm-yyy" | findstr "16:00"

dir /s | findstr "dd-mm-yyy" | findstr "18:*"

dir /s *.*p*g | findstr "dd-mm-yyy"

dir /s *.do* | findstr "dd-mm-yyy"

dir /s "*.pdf" | findstr %date%"

dir C:\Users\ /s *.pdf

dir /s C:\Users\ *.pdf  <-- not is this format

dir /od /tc  # Wrong order of switches
dir /tc /od  # Correct order

dir *.jpg *.png /tc | findstr "%date%"
