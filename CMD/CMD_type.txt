:: Used to display the contents of text files directly in the Command Prompt.

:: Display a single file
	type myfile.txt

:: Display file from specific path
	type C:\Users\John\Documents\notes.txt
	type "C:\Users\John Doe\Documents\my file.txt"
 	
:: Using with environment variables
	type %USERPROFILE%\Documents\file.txt

:: Display multiple files sequentially
	type file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

:: Pipe output to other commands
	type log.txt | find "ERROR"
::	Shows only lines containing "ERROR".

	type config.txt | sort
::	Sorts all lines alphabetically.

	type data.txt | more	
::	If the file is large, 'more' paginates the output — one screen at a time.
::	Press Space for next page, Enter for next line, Ctrl+C to quit.

	type file.txt | clip
::	Copies the entire file content to clipboard

:: Redirect output to new file (copy)
	type original.txt > copy.txt
::	This overwrites output.txt with the contents of file1.txt.
::	If output.txt doesn’t exist, it’s created.
::	If it exists, it’s replaced.

	type file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
::	This creates combined.txt if it doesn't exist and if it does ...
::	its content is over-written by first the contents in file1.txt ...
::	followed by the contents in file2.txt. 
::	file1.txt and file2.txt is effectively combined in combined.txt

:: Append to existing file
	type newdata.txt >> existing.txt
::	This appends the contents of file2.txt to the end of output.txt.

:: Redirect output to a device
	type file.txt > NUL
::	Sends the file’s contents to the void — often used just to test file readability without cluttering the console.

:: Search within files
	type server.log | find "404"
	type *.log | find "exception"	
::	Displays only lines containing the targeted word "404' or "exception" in this case

	type log.txt | findstr /r /i "error warning critical"
::	For multiple non-sequential words

:: Display with line numbers
	type file.txt | findstr /n "^"

:: Count matching lines
	type file.txt | find /c "INFO"
::	Returns how many lines contain “INFO”.

:: Extract sections or remove noise
	type server.log | findstr /v /i "debug info"
::	Shows only lines not containing those words.

:: Check if file contains specific text without outputting text to stdout
	type config.txt | find "password" >nul && echo Found || echo Not found
 
:: Display only first few lines
	type longfile.txt | head
 
:: Display file with timestamp
	echo %date% %time% & type log.txt
 
:: To check if file exists before typing
	if exist myfile.txt (type myfile.txt) else (echo File not found)

:: Cleanest way in pure CMD to create an empty file:
	type nul > filename.txt
	:: nul is a special device
	:: nul acts like a virtual empty file — it’s the Windows equivalent of /dev/null in Unix.
	:: Reading from nul produces no data, writing to nul discards data.
