	type vim_globalTable_16Aug.txt | findstr /i "table"

print out the contents of the file vim_globalTab .... inside the cmd
piping into findstr which looks of the word 'table' (/i means case insensitive)

	type vim_globalTable_16Aug.txt | findstr /i /r "\<table\>" 

(all that is uniquely the word table and not a sequence of letters in another word (not datatable or defaulttable)

	type vim_globalTable_16Aug.txt | findstr /i /r /v "\<table\>" 

(all that is not 'table')


:: findstr regex ≠ normal regex

:: findstr uses a weird, limited regex engine.
:: While in most regex systems \< and \> mean “word boundary,” in findstr, they only work on alphanumeric characters (A–Z, 0–9, and _).

:: So: \<gimp\> matches gimp as a standalone word ✅

:: but \<.exe\> fails ❌ because . is not a word character

:: → it doesn’t recognize .exe as a valid word boundary match
