:: The wmic (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) tool is a CLI front-end to WMI.

:: WMIC basic syntax:
	wmic [global switches] [alias] [where clause] [verb] [parameters]

:: 	Global switches: Apply to the wmic tool itself, not individual commands.
:: 	Alias: Refers to WMI classes (like process, os, useraccount, etc.)
:: 	Where clause: Filter results.
:: 	Verb: The action to perform (get, list, call, etc.)
:: 	Parameters: Extra arguments for the verb.


:: Global switches
:: 	Switch			Meaning
:: 	/node:<name>		Connect to a remote computer.
:: 	/user:<domain\user>	Specify user for remote connection.
:: 	/password:<password>	Specify password for remote connection.
:: 	/namespace:<namespace>	Specify a WMI namespace (default is root\cimv2).
:: 	/role:<role>		Specify role (rarely used).
:: 	/authority:<authority>	Specify authority for authentication.
:: 	`/interactive:on	off`
:: 	/output:<filename>	Redirect output to file.
:: 	/format:<format>	Specify output format (list, table, csv, htable, etc.)
