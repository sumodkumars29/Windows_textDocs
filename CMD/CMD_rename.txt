:: Correct usage from inside D:\:
ren "Forms\InsertImage_Format_Position.docm" "Passport Size Photo 35x45frame_Macros.docm"

:: If you want to rename it from elsewhere (if you are inside C:\ and want to rename a file in D:\), then:
ren "D:\Forms\InsertImage_Format_Position.docm" "Passport Size Photo 35x45frame_Macros.docm"

:: cmd help info: help ren
:: Renames a file or files.

RENAME [drive:][path]filename1 filename2.
REN [drive:][path]filename1 filename2.

:: Note that you cannot specify a new drive or path for your destination file.

:: Key points about ren in Windows CMD:
:: You can only change the name, not the path.
:: That means the first argument is the file (with path if needed).
:: The second argument must be just the new file name, without a path.
:: Spaces in file names require quotes.
